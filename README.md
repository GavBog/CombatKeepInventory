# CombatKeepInventory
Keep your inventory if you are killed naturally, Lose your inventory if Killed by a Player.

You Keep your Inventory if you Die to anything but a player (or vice versa in config.yml)! Great mix between KeepInventory and Vanilla! Good for SMP's where people complain about losing their stuff to the Void or in Lava!

Conflicts with essentials.keepinv permission use combatkeepinv.alwayskeep instead.
Make sure you have Gamerule KeepInventory set to False.
